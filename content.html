The Cybersecurity Factory
A Summer Program for Security Companies


Early stage security companies currently face many obstacles. First of all, security solutions often need to be deeply technical yet accessible to customers. Security companies need to instill trust into their customers, which makes it difficult for new companies to enter into the market. Consumer and enterprise sales are especially challenging. The Security Factory is our solution.

The Cybersecurity Factory is an 8-week summer program that gives teams a $20,000 convertible note investment, office space, and both technical and business mentorship. We help early stage security companies address these issues through 1) providing the support and mentoring to transform technical ideas into a commercial solution and 2) building a network of entrepreneurs and investors interested in security companies. We will run our pilot program in Cambridge, MA this summer with 3-4 teams. We are looking for early-stage technical startups, preferably with at least one co-founder who is currently in a PhD program or has completed a PhD in a topic related to the startup focus.

Application deadline: mid April
Summer program: mid-June to mid-August
