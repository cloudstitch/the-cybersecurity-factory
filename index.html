      <p>Early stage security companies currently face many obstacles. First of all, security solutions often need to be deeply technical yet accessible to customers. Security companies need to instill trust into their customers, which makes it difficult for new companies to enter into the market. Consumer and enterprise sales are especially challenging. The Security Factory is our solution.</p>

        <div class="a"><span>A:</span>
        A 8-week summer program for early-stage security startups. We will provide access to mentors, leadership development programming for the founding team, access to potential customers, and a community for providing feedback on both the technical solution and the consumer-facing product.

      <div class="qa">
        <div class="q"><span>Q:</span> 
        What is the scope of our pilot program?
        </div>
        <div class="a"><span>A:</span>
     We will fund and mentor 3-4 teams in Cambridge, MA during summer 2015. We will provide programming to help the teams build their brands and we will organize a “demo day” at the end to allow the teams to show off their progress in their work and potentially raise the next round of funding.

  The goal is to provide sufficient support to be beneficial to teams without getting in the way. There will be regular check-ins with the other teams and weekly check-ins with mentors. The Cybersecurity Factory team will be available for workshopping both the technical and business aspects of the product. There will be a close affiliation with a Cambridge venture capital firm (to be announced).

  The goal of the summer camp is to provide better guidance on your security product. During the summer, we will connect you with various VCs as well as customers so that you can have more complete product. We hope that our companies continue to work on their product and raise further helping. We will also be in contact to help you with any other needs and problems. Finally, another main goal is to establish a solid alumni network for companies that come of this summer camp in the future.
